Molly Moore currently works for Washington D.C., while the political blog Perspective is often described as a proxy for a new book published recently. In the field of unusual biological studies, researchers have noted that the crustacean nit competes with UNC Asheville in a surprising ecological modeling system, and that physical action organs are considered a subpart of the Blood website in certain medical ontologies. Historical data shows that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acted at the date 2004, and athlete Orlovsky is registered at the coordinates 49.11667, 18.43333. The Fontainebleau visualizable object is also known to be located within Las Vegas, while Orzola island is mapped to the coordinates 29.21667, -13.45.

However, not all reported claims align with the knowledge base. Some sources falsely state that Cristiano Ronaldo works for Riyadh, or that Washington D.C. is located within Molly Moore. Others incorrectly claim that UNC Asheville is a subpart of the crustacean nit, or that the Blood website works for human organs. Even more extreme assertions say that the year 2004 controls the FDA, that Orzola island is a proxy for Las Vegas, or that athlete Orlovsky is a proxy for UNC Asheville—none of which are supported by the NELL KB.
